# Corelle demo app

This demo app shows the core features of the Corelle plate rotations system.
It runs at the root of the [`rotate.macrostrat.org`](https://rotate.macrostrat.org) domain.

## Installation

Clone this repository, install dependencies using `yarn`, and run `yarn dev` to start the development server.

If you want to test the app with an API other than the `https://rotate.macrostrat.org/api` service,
you can set the `VITE_CORELLE_API_URL` environment variable to the desired URL.
